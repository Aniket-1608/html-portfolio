<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! First and foremost, I extend my heartfelt gratitude for taking the time to
  explore my work.</p>

<p>My name is Aniket Janbandhu, and I am currently a final year undergraduate student pursuing my B-Tech in Ocean
  Engineering and Naval Architecture. Originally hailing from Nagpur, Maharashtra, I bring a blend of diverse
  experiences and passions to the table.</p>

<p>In the realm of technology, my interests lie primarily in Software Engineering, Backend Development, and Blockchain
  Development. These domains have continually captivated my attention and fueled my pursuit of excellence in these
  areas.</p>

<p>During my journey, I had the privilege of undertaking enriching internships that broadened my horizons. At
  Zura Games Private Limited, I delved into the dynamic world of backend development, harnessing the power of the MERN
  stack to create robust solutions. Additionally, my stint as a Blockchain Developer at the same organization allowed me
  to immerse myself in the innovative landscape of blockchain technology, further honing my skills and understanding in
  this cutting-edge field.</p>

<p>Beyond the confines of technology, I find solace and exhilaration in sports. Cricket, table tennis, football, and
  badminton are among my favorite pastimes, offering me both physical vigor and mental rejuvenation.
</p>
<p>
  As I embark on this journey, I am driven by a relentless passion for learning, a commitment to excellence, and a
  desire to make meaningful contributions to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
</p>
<p>
  Thank you once again for visiting my portfolio. I invite you to explore my projects, delve into my experiences, and
  contact me in embracing the boundless possibilities that lie ahead.
